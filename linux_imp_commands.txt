How to change directory
permissions in Linux
To change directory permissions in Linux, use the following:
chmod +rwx filename to add permissions.
chmod -rwx directoryname to remove permissions.
chmod +x filename to allow executable permissions.
chmod -wx filename to take out write and executable permissions.
Note that “r” is for read, “w” is for write, and “x” is for execute. 

How to Change Directory Permissions in Linux for the Group Owners and Others
The command for changing directory permissions for group owners is similar, but add a “g” for group or “o” for users:

chmod g+w filename
chmod g-wx filename
chmod o+w filename
chmod o-rwx foldername


Permission numbers are:

0 = ---
1 = --x
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r-
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx

Using sudo without a password
You can also configure sudo to not ask for a password to verify your identity. For many situations (such as for real servers) this would be considered too much of a security risk. However, for developers running a RHEL VM on their laptop, this is a reasonable thing to do since access to their laptops is probably already protected by a password.

To set this up, two different methods are shown. You can either edit /etc/sudoers or you can create a new file in /etc/sudoers.d/.  The first is more straightforward, but the latter is easier to script and automate.

Edit /etc/sudoers
As root, run visudo to edit /etc/sudoers and make the following changes. The advantage of using visudo is that it will validate the changes to the file.

The default /etc/sudoers file contains two lines for group wheel; the NOPASSWD: line is commented out.  Uncomment that line and comment out the wheel line without NOPASSWD. When you are done, it should look like this:

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Same thing without a password
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
